Think of it more as tutorials than as complete guides to fully mastery the presented techniques. \n\n# Covered topics\n\nThe following topics are presented here in the chronological order in which they were studied. If you are new to all of them, please respect this order. All manipulations were done with the R programmation language.\n\n- [Data Classification](pages/tp1.qmd)\n- [Principal Component Analysis](pages/tp2.qmd) - Incomplete\n- [Regression](pages/tp3.qmd) - Incomplete\n- [Partitionning Trees](pages/tp4.qmd) - Incomplete\n\n::::: {.custom}\n::: {.callout-citation}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\ncitation()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nTo cite R in publications use:\n\n  R Core Team (2023). _R: A Language and Environment for Statistical\n  Computing_.
