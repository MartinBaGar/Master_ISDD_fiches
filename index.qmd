In this website (still in construction), I'll present various topics that were covered during my **Master Bio-Informatics: *In Silico Drug Design*** at the Université Paris-Cité.  
This is not professional content so if you see that something isn't right and would like to volunteer, please contact me at this address: [martin.bari-garnier@etu.unistra.fr](mailto:martin.bari-garnier@etu.unistra.fr).
Enjoy !
